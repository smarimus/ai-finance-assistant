Key benefits of diversification:
1. **Risk Reduction**: By investing in different assets, you reduce the impact of any single investment's poor performance
2. **Smoother Returns**: Diversified portfolios tend to have more stable returns over time
3. **Protection Against Volatility**: Different assets often perform differently under various market conditions

Example: Instead of buying stock in just one company, you might buy stocks from different industries (technology, healthcare, finance) or different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate).

Here's how it works:
1. **Year 1**: You invest $1,000 at 10% interest = $1,100
2. **Year 2**: You earn 10% on $1,100 = $1,210  
3. **Year 3**: You earn 10% on $1,210 = $1,331

The key is time - the longer you let compound interest work, the more powerful it becomes. This is why starting to invest early is so important for retirement planning.

**Real-world tip**: Even small amounts invested regularly can grow significantly over decades due to compound interest.

**Stocks (Equities)**:
- Represent ownership shares in a company
- Potential for higher returns but also higher risk
- Value fluctuates based on company performance and market sentiment
- May pay dividends (regular income payments)

**Bonds (Fixed Income)**:
- Essentially loans you make to companies or governments
- Generally lower risk and more predictable returns
- Pay regular interest payments
- Principal returned at maturity

**Key Differences**:
- Risk: Stocks are generally riskier than bonds
- Returns: Stocks historically offer higher long-term returns
- Income: Bonds provide more predictable income streams
- Portfolio role: Many investors use both for balanced portfolios

**Disclaimer**: This is educational information only. All investments carry risk and past performance doesn't guarantee future results."""
