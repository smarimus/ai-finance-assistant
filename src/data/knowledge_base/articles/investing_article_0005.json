Define Your Investment Goals\nDetermine Your Strategy:\nIn accordance with your investment goals, decide whether you are looking for growth stocks, value stocks, dividend-paying stocks, or another type of investment – or a deft combination of equities that hit several different types of metrics.\nSet a Time Horizon:\nDetermine if you are investing for quick, short-term profits, a longer-term retirement nest egg, income, or something else entirely.\nRisk Tolerance:\nAssess how much risk you are willing to take on – which, of course, is influenced by time horizon and overall investment goals. Figuring this out will clarify whether you should gravitate toward more high-risk, high-reward stocks or more stable, lower-risk investments.\n2. Set Your Screening Criteria\nHere are some examples of fundamental metrics you might want to consider filtering for:\nMarket cap:\nDefine the size of the companies you are interested in (e.g., small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap).\nPrice-to-Earnings ratio:\nFilter companies by P/E ratio to identify undervalued (low P/E) or overvalued (high P/E) stocks.\nEarnings-per-\nLook for companies with consistent or accelerating EPS growth.\nReturn on equity:\nHigh ROE can indicate efficient management and profitability.\nDebt to equity:\nAssess a company’s leverage. Lower ratios generally indicate a safer investment.\nDividend yield:\nIf you are looking for steady income, filter by dividend yield to find companies that offer solid payouts.\n\nReturns:\nLook for stocks with strong price momentum over specific time frames (e.g., 3 months, 6 months, 1 year).\nVolume:\nHigh trading volume can indicate strong investor interest.\nMoving averages:\nStocks’ position in relation to various moving averages can demonstrate technical strength or weakness over different time frames.\n3. Apply the Filters and Analyze the Results\nInput\nthe selected criteria into the Investing.com Stock Screener.\nFurther narrow down\nthe list by adding or adjusting criteria as you consider your investment goals.\nResearch further:\nConduct deeper research into the companies that meet your screening criteria. Look into their financial statements, industry trends, management quality, and future prospects.\nDiversify:\nEnsure that your selected stocks are from diverse sectors in order to minimize your overall risk. Many investors will also reserve a tiny percentage of their portfolio for high-risk, high-reward stocks for lottery-ticket scenarios, even if the overall portfolio largely contains more secure bets.\nEvaluate risks:\nConsider any potential risks associated with the stocks, such as market volatility, economic factors, and industry-specific risks.\n4. Monitor and Adjust\nRegular review:\nContinuously monitor the performance of your selected stocks.\nRebalance portfolio:\nPeriodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\nStay informed:\nKeep up to date with news and developments that may impact your investments.\nUsing Default Settings and Preset Filters\nCopied\nCopy To Clipboard\nIf you are new to stock screening or want to save time, you can use Investing.com’s Popular Screeners. You might also save time by using the basic metrics available in the Popular tab of the screener itself.\nTo use the Popular Screeners feature, simply click “View All” in that feature box:\nThen review the many preset screens offered, evaluating the screens’ appropriateness for your investment goals, risk tolerance and time horizon.\nWhen you’ve decided on a theme or strategy, simply click on it and review the results. Also note that you can customize a preset filter in any way you wish.\nFinally, you can save the filter if you’ve found one you particularly like, adding it to the “My Screeners” section referenced earlier in this article:\nWrapping Up\nCopied\nCopy To Clipboard\nThe Investing.com Stock Screener is a powerful, easy-to-use tool that can help you identify the best stocks to further your investment goals.
